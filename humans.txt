# -- Human Beings by Van Halen
#There is just enough Christ in me
#To make me feel almost guilty
#Is that why God made us bleed
#To make us see we're Humans Being?
#
#You break this, I'll break all that
#You break my balls with all your crap
#Spread your disease like lemmings breeding
#That's what makes us Humans Being
#
#Shine on, shine on
#Shine on, shine on
#
#(Guitar Solo)
#
#Yeah! Some low life flat head scum infects
#The sickness in his eyes reflects
#You wonder why your life is screaming
#Wonder why we're Humans Being
#
#Shine on, shine on
#Shine on, shine on
#
#(Guitar Solo)
#
#Humans, Humans Being
#We're just Humans (That's what makes us)
#Humans Being (That's what makes us)
#We're just humans (That's what makes us)
#Humans Being (That's what makes us) We're just humans (That's what makes us)
#Humans Being (That's what makes us)
#Humans Being!
#We're just humans (That's what makes us)
#Humans Being (That's what makes us)
#Humans Being!
